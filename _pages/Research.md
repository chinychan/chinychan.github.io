1. Functional Materials for OLEDs
======

<br/> <img src='/images/research1.jpg' width="400" height="200">
<div style="text-align: justify">
Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) offer distinct advantages, including light-weight, high flexibility and high color contrast. We are very interested in the design and synthesis of new functional molecules for improving the performance of OLEDs (efficiency, stability, driving voltage, color purity, etc).
