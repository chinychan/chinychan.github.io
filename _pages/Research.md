**1. Functional materials for Organic Light-emitting diodes (OLEDs)**

<br/> <img src='/images/research1.png' width="600" height="400">

<div style="text-align: justify">
Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) offer distinct advantages over liquid crystal display, including light-weight, high flexibility and high contrast; however, the efficiency, color purity and device stability of OLEDs are still needed for improvement.  We are very much interested in the design and synthesis of new functional materials for achieving high-performance OLEDs.
