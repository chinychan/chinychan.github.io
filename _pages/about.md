Our lab focuses on the design and synthesis of organic and organometallic pi-conjugated molecules. We are ambitious to explore new chemistry and new physics. Synthetic chemistry is the key to create new compounds with tunable photophysical, electrochemical and thermal properties in solution and thin film state. Our newly synthesized compounds are apllied for various practical applications, including organic electronics (e.g. organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic solar cells (OSCs), etc), photocatalysis, bio-sensing and others.
