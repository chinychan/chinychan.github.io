<div style="text-align: justify">
TADF organic materials can harvest both 25 % of singlet and 75 % of triplet excitons, resulting in 100 % internal quantum efficiency without the use of precious metal. TADF materials are considered as 3rd-generation display technology for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). We are interested in the design and synthesis of TADF materials for acheiving high-performance OLEDs.
