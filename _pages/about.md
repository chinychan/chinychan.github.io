    Our lab focuses on the design and synthesis of organic and organometallic pi-conjugated molecules. We are ambitious to explore new chemistry and new physics (from zero to one). In our lab, synthetic chemistry is the key to create new compounds with tunable photophysical, electrochemical and thermal properties in solution and thin film state. We are also interested in exploring potnetial applications of our newly synthesized compoundsin the areas of organic electronics (e.g. organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic solar cells (OSCs), etc), photocatalysis, bio-sensing and others.
